# Portfolio Update Development Plan

## 1. Context and Requirements

The primary objective of this project was to update the personal portfolio website to accurately reflect the latest information from the user's resume. The existing portfolio was outdated, and the content needed to be refreshed to showcase the most current skills, work experience, and certifications.

**Key Findings:**
- The professional title was "ETL Developer" and needed to be updated to "Data Engineer".
- The "About Me" summary was outdated.
- The Work Experience section was missing the most recent roles.
- The Skills section and their corresponding visual progress bars did not reflect current expertise.
- The Certifications section was missing the new "AWS Certified Data Engineer Associate" certification.
- The downloadable CV was an older version.

**Requirements:**
- Update all textual content to align with the new resume.
- Replace the old CV file with the new one.
- Ensure the styling and layout accommodate the new content correctly.
- Verify that all changes are rendered properly in a web browser.
